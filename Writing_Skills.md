# **Writing Notes**

The following are point notes for scientific writing compiled mostly from Higham's *Handbook of Writing for Mathematical Sciences*.

## Writing a Paper
###### Title
- Action words such as *computing* or *estimating*
- One sentence summary, if possible
- Alliteration is good

###### Abstract
- Write from scratch after the paper
- Should be like a mini paper
- Avoid equations and references
- Use simple language
- Give an idea of the results/conclusions
- Do not start with *In this paper/This paper*
- Above is extra important for conferences since there is no paper

###### Introduction
- First sentence is most important
- Limit to a few hundred words
- Breifly summarize results
- Often you can remove the first sentence or two and have the same effect
- Give an outline of the paper (unless it is quite short)

###### Tables
- Avoid repetition (put info in header)
- Minimize number of rules
- Columns instead of rows

###### Conclusions
- Do not simply repeat previous sections
- Offer another viewpoint
- Mention further work

## Revision
- Can words/phrases/sentences be removed without changing the meaning?
- Should any paragraphs be switched?
- Are there any ambiguities?
- Is there unnecessary repetition?
- Passive to active voice?
- Is each claim supported?
- Is the notation consistent?
- Are the references correct (to figures, sections...)?

## Publishing

###### Choosing a Journal
- Read objectives of the Journal
- See what journals are referenced a lot in your paper
- Audience

## General
- Number all equations
- No 'Figure x shows', figures cannot show (or sections or papers)
- Space between value and unit
- Use dictionaries and thesauruses (Including math dictionaries)
- Use examples
- Punctuate equations
- Remind the reader of the nature of an equation when referencing
 	- 'Combining the recurrence (3.14) with inequality (2.9)'
is more helpful than 'Combining (3.14) and (2.9)'
- Avoid tall in-line equations
- Spell check!
- Oxford commas
- false if (!!!)
- Reference all tables and figures (and citations)
- Cite original sources when possible
- Dashes (!!!)

## Notation
- Simplify notation, words instead of symbols
- Be consistent with the ordering of variables
- Do not introduce symbols that are not used
- Do not start sentences with symbols
- 'The *k* th term...'
- Display an equation when
	- It needs numbered
	- It would be hard to read in-line
	- It requires special attention
	- It introduces an important variable / concept

## Style
- Active instead of passive ('*x* did *y*' instead of '*y* was done by *x*')
- Use an adjective or adverb only if it earns its place
- Short paragraphs are good

## Grammar
- A sentence such as 'we use the 1, 2, and Inf-norms' should instead be 'we use the 1-, 2-, and Inf-norms', as *1* and *2* are prefixes of *norm* as well
- Use *the* if the quantity is unique, and *a/an* if it is not
- Italicize *et al.*, *e.g.*, or *i.e.* (and any other latin words)
- Spell numbers less than 10

## Distinctions
###### Affect/Effect
- *Affect* is a verb meaning to produce a change
- *Effect* is a noun meaning the result of a change
- Examples: 'Multiple roots affect the convergence rate of Newton's method', 'One effect of multiple roots is to reduce the convergence rate of Newton's method to linear'.

###### Due to/owing to
- Use *due to* where you could use 'caused by', or 'attributable to'
- Use *owing to* where you could use 'because of'
- Thus 'The instability is due to a rank deficient submatrix', but 'Owing to a rank deficient submatrix the computed result
was inaccurate'.

###### Fewer/less
- *Less* refers to quantity, amount, or size
- *Fewer* to number
- Thus 'the zeros of *f(x)* are less than those of *g(x)*' means that if *x* is a zero of *f* and *y* a zero of *g* then *x < y*, whereas 'the zeros of *f(x)* are fewer than those of *g(x)*' means that *g* has more zeros than *f*.
- Rule of thumb that *less* should be used with singular nouns and *fewer* with plural nouns: less research, less computation, fewer graduates, fewer papers

###### Practice/practise
- *Practice* is the noun
- *Practise* the verb (as with advice and advise)

###### Which/that
- *That* defines and restricts
- *Which* informs and does not restrict
- 'Consider the Pei matrix, which is positive definite'. We are being told additional information about the Pei matrix: that it is positive definite.
- 'Consider the Pei matrix that is positive definite'. Now we are being asked to focus on a particular Pei matrix from among several: the one that is positive definite.
- Which-clauses are surrounded by commas, or preceded by a comma if at the end of a sentence. If you're not sure whether to use which or that, see whether your sentence looks right with commas around the relevant clause. Sometimes it pays to introduce a wicked which to avoid ugly repetition, as has been done in the sentence "This approach is similar to that which we used in our earlier paper" (though "the one we used" is better). A rule of thumb discussed in is to replace which by that whenever it sounds right to do so.

###### Compare with/compare to
- *Compare with* analyses similarities and differences between two things
- *Compare to* states a resemblance between them
- *Compare x and y* is probably best

## Words/Phrases to Avoid
- Avoid *essentially, basically, actually, very, really, currently, in fact, thing, without doubt, in this context*
- Avoid *problem* since it is ambiguous whether it refers to difficulty of a step, or the problem of the paper
- Don't start a sentence with *there is/are* or *it is*
- In 'the reason ... is because' because is redundant
- *This* and *it* can be ambiguous
- Often *instructive* is a better word than *interesting*
