Hey

Sleeping through the day cause I work all night
Get out the way things are coming a-live
Look over there, another fight
I guess I should have seen the warning signs

(We could be together?)
I am not looking for a fight
(Change the world forever?)
Just want to make it through the night
(Make it all together)
They’re really giving me the eye
eye, eye, eye

I think I’m gonna lose it, lose it, lose it
I think I’m gonna lose it, lose it, lose it

I think I’m gonna lose it!

The walls are growing ears
I’m paranoid
No need to fear what you can’t avoid
Don’t let them in don’t let them out
I gave you something you could scream about

(We could be together?)
I am not looking for a fight
(Change the world forever?)
Just want to make it through the night
(Make it all together)
They’re really giving me the eye
eye, eye, eye

I think I’m gonna lose it, lose it, lose it
I think I’m gonna lose it,
I think I’m gonna lose it, lose it, lose it
I think I’m gonna lose it

No no no nothings wrong with dreaming
Go, go, go, you're dreaming all away
One love, one life
That’s enough to get you through the night
Tomorrows gotta be a brighter day

I think I’m gonna lose it, lose it, lose it
I think I’m gonna lose it (I think I’m gonna lose it)
I think I’m gonna lose it, lose it, lose it
I think I’m gonna lose it
I think I’m gonna lose it, lose it, lose it
I think I’m gonna lose it
I think I’m gonna lose it, lose it, lose it
I think I’m gonna lose it, lose it, lose it

(We could be together?)
I am not looking for a fight
(Change the world forever?)
Just want to make it through the night
(Make it all together)
They’re really giving me the eye
eye, eye, eye oh the eye

No no no nothings wrong with dreaming
Go, go, go, you're dreaming all away
One love, one life
That’s enough to get you through the night
Tomorrows gonna be a brighter day

They come alive when I work the nights
I guess I should have seen the warning signs
