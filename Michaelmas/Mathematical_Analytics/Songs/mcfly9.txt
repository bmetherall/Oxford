Please, please, Lindsay, please...

Set the scene,
I think I'm in love now,
Your eyes are green,
you come from above now,
Easy girl,
I think we're alone now,
Let's get the motion in the ocean,
So turn of your phone now!

I wanna put my hands on your skin,
Underneath the clothes that you're in,
So kick off your shoes,
Let the fun begin!

C-C-C-Come home with me now,
M-M-M-Must be a dreamer,
I wanna get with you!

Please, please, Lindsay, please!

The sun sets the colour of fire,
Your red hair is taking me higher,
I'm not sure what's happening to me,
If you were God then I would believe,
You love yourself more than you love me!

C-C-C-Come home with me now,
M-M-M-Must be a dreamer,
I wanna get with you!

C-C-C-Come home with me now,
You got me thinking of England,
I wanna get with you!
(Yeah you know i do!)

Please, please, Lindsay, please!
Please, please, Lindsay, please!

Girl, I'm talking to you now...
I thought that you knew now

Wanna run my hands through your hair,
Cover the room with your underwear,
Make out like we don't care.

C-C-C-Come home with me now,
M-M-M-Must be a dreamer,
I wanna get with you!

(Please, please, please...)

C-C-C-Come home with me now,
Oh! You got me thinking of England,
I wanna get with you!
(Yeah, you now i do!)

Please, please, Lindsay, please!
Please, please, Lindsay, please!

Please, please, Lindsay!
Please, please, Lindsay!
Please, please, please,
Please me...!
