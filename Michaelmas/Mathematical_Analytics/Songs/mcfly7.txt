Listen!
We've got a situation
There always putting us down
We are the generation
Can't keep us underground

Is it my imagination
Or do you feel good?

We're on a one way mission
We can take it or die
We are the sunshine nation
Can't take the satellites

Is it my imagination
Or do you feel good?

What a day, What a day, What a day
What a day, What a day, What a day
What a day, What a day, What a day
What a day, these are the days

Running the world
It's the time of our lives
And baby we wont ever die
cos we're the young we're alright

We've gotta stop this feeling
Cos i don't wanna live twice
we better start believing
before we run out of time

Is it my imagination
Or do you feel good?

What a day, What a day, What a day
What a day, What a day, What a day
What a day, What a day, What a day
What a day, these are the days

Running the world
It's the time of our lives
And baby we wont ever die
cos we're the young we're alright

alright, hey

Running the world
It's the time of our lives
And baby we wont ever die
Fight till we fall
Standing tall
Cos time is on our side
Cos we're the young we're alright

yeah we're alright
yeah we're alright
yeah we're alright

Is it my imagination (No!)
Is it my imagination (No!)
Is it my imagination (No!)

We're the young we're alright
