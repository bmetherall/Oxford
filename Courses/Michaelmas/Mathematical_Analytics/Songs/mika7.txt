Big girl, you are beautiful

Walks into the room
Feels like a big balloon
I said, 'Hey, girl, you are beautiful.'
Diet Coke and a pizza please
Diet Coke, I'm on my knees
Screaming, 'Big girl, you are beautiful.'

You take your skinny girl
I feel like I'm gonna die
'Cause a real woman
Needs a real man here's why

You take your girl
And multiply her by four
Now a whole lot of woman
Needs a whole lot more

Get yourself to the Butterfly Lounge
Find yourself a big lady
Big boy, come on around
And they'll be calling you baby

No need to fantasize
Since I was in my braces
A watering hole
With the girls around
And curves in all the right places

Big girl, you are beautiful
Big girl, you are beautiful
Big girl, you are beautiful
Big girl, you are beautiful

Walks in to the room
Feels like a big balloon
I said, 'Hey girls you are beautiful.'
Diet Coke and a pizza please
Diet Coke, I'm on my knees
Screaming, 'Big girl you are beautiful.'

You take your girl
And multiply her by four
Now a whole lot of woman
Needs a whole lot more

Get yourself to the Butterfly Lounge
Find yourself a big lady
Big boy, come on around
And they'll be calling you baby

No need to fantasize
Since I was in my braces
A watering hole
With the girls around
And curves in all the right places

Big girl, you are beautiful
Big girl, you are beautiful
Big girl, you are beautiful
Big girl, you are beautiful

Get yourself to the Butterfly Lounge
Find yourself a big lady
Big boy come on around
And they'll be calling you baby

No need to fantasize
Since I was in my braces
A watering hole
With the girls around
And curves in all the right places

Big girl, you are beautiful
Big girl, you are beautiful
Big girl, you are beautiful
Big girl, you are beautiful
Oh, you are beautiful

Get yourself to the Butterfly Lounge
Find yourself a big lady
Big boy, come on around
And they'll be calling you baby

No need to fantasize
Since I was in my braces
A watering hole
With the girls around
And curves in all the right places

Big girl, you are beautiful
Big girl, you are beautiful
Big girl, you are beautiful
Big girl, you are beautiful
Oh, you are beautiful

Get yourself to the Butterfly Lounge
