This is the way you left me
I'm not pretending
No hope, no love, no glory
No happy ending
This is the way that we love
Like it's forever
Then live the rest of our life
But not together

Wake up in the morning, stumble on my life
Can't get no love without sacrifice
If anything should happen, I'd guess I wish you well
Mm, a little bit of heaven, but a little bit of hell

This is the hardest story
That I have ever told
No hope, or love, or glory
Happy endings gone forever more

I feel as if I'm wasted
And I wasted everyday

This is the way you left me
I'm not pretending
No hope, no love, no glory
No happy ending
This is the way that we love
Like it's forever
Then live the rest of our life
But not together

Two o'clock in the morning, something's on my mind
Can't get no rest, keep walkin' around
If I pretend that nothin' ever went wrong
I can get to my sleep
I can think that we just carried on

This is the hardest story
That I have ever told
No hope, or love, or glory
Happy endings gone forever more

I feel as if I'm wasted
And I wasted everyday

This is the way you left me
I'm not pretending
No hope, no love, no glory
No happy ending
This is the way that we love
Like it's forever
Then live the rest of our life
But not together

Little bit of love
Little bit of love
There ain't a better love
Little bit of love
Little bit of love
Need to be love, love
Little bit of love

I feel as if I'm wasted
And I wasted everyday, hey, hey, hey

This is the way you left me
I'm not pretending
No hope, no love, no glory
No happy ending
This is the way that we love
Like it's forever
To live the rest of our life
But not together

This is the way you left me
I'm not pretending
No hope, no love, no glory
No happy ending
This is the way that we love
Like it's forever
To live the rest of our life
But not together

This is the way you left me
I'm not pretending
No hope, no love, no glory
No happy ending
