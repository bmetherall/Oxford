It's only been a day
But it's like I cant go on
I just wanna say
I never meant to do you wrong

And I remember you told me baby
Somethings gotta give
If I cant be the one to hold you baby
I don't think I could live

Now I'm so sick of being lonely
This is killing me so slowly
Don't pretend that you don't know me
'Cause thats the worst thing you could do!
Now I'm singing such a sad song
These things never seem to last long
Something that I never planned on
Help me baby I'm so sick of being lonely

The stuff is in my house
So many things I cant ignore
Your coat's still on the coach
Your photos on my freezer door

And I remember you told me baby
Somethings gotta give
If I cant be the one to hold you baby
I don't think I could live

Now I'm so sick of being lonely
This is killing me so slowly
Don't pretend that you don't know me
Thats the worst thing you could do!
Now I'm singing such a sad song
These things never seem to last long
Something that I never planned on
Help me baby I'm so sick of being lonely

I am so lonely

And I remember you told me baby
Somethings gotta give
If I cant be the one to hold you baby
I don't think I could live

Now I'm so sick of being lonely
This is killing me so slowly
Don't pretend that you don't know me
Thats the worst thing you could do!

Now I'm singing such a sad song
These things never seem to last long
Something that I never planned on
Help me baby I'm so sick of being lonely

I am so lonely
I am so lonely...
