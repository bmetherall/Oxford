\title{Predicting NCAA March Madness 2019 with SpringRank}
\author{Brady Metherall}

\date{16 March, 2020}

\maketitle

Each spring the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) hold a single-elimination tournament across the United States known as March Madness. The top 68 US college basketball teams in Division I take part, with the winner being crowned the national champion. The champions of each of the 32 Division I conferences automatically included, and the remaining 36 spots are determined by a selection commitee.

We use the box scores of *** 6000 NCAA games before March Madness 2019 \cite{wirth}; this data contains 649 teams from all three divisions. From this, we build our directed adjacency matrix, where each game is represented by an edge from the winner to the loser.
