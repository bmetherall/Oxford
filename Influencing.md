# Influencing People
## Networking Skills
Meeting strangers; appearance; business card etiquette; lots of one questions? 'What is it like...? How did you get into this?'

'What is you aim? How is your company...? What is your priority?'

## Networking Challenge
Go to another CDT's event or another dept's seminar... network your way in. The aim is to introduce yourself and learn the names and roles of as many other people as possible. You are not there to learn... but inevitably...

## One-to-One Skills
- What is you motivation?
- Do prepare for difficult questions and difficult issues (try writing things down!)
- Don't wing it. You will fail eventually and possibly in the most important conversation of your career.
- Use a closed question to gain and memorialise agreement.
- Body language.

## Listening
- Use of Open questions
- "What do you propose?"

## Vocabulary
- Passion, Pride... get out of the box
- Interview skills
- Silence
- Surprise - get out of the stereo-type

## Gaining agreement/persuading
- Don't talk too much
- dont justify yourself
- Ideally you want the other side to persuade themselves.
- Suggest? Ask then what they think is best?

## Hidden signals in negotiating:
- for example these can be called "buying signals"
- Do they spontaneously say thinking that we believe?
- Are they ready?
- Is there an obvious lead to take responsibility?
- How will the decision be made (sign off)?
- Is there a budget?
- Did they push back about high cost?
- Did they ask who else you are talking to?
- Make list as soon as you are out of the room. Do NOT wait.

## Preparation
- PLAN (including anticipate difficult questions)
- ACT
- DEBRIEF
- DECIDE next step

## Qualifying things out
You have a vote: protect your time

## The Darker arts
- Avoiding being closed - move the issue into the emotional/subjective domain away from the objective/facts domain.
- "I feel uncomfortable.." "I am shocked"" both work well
- Given out difficult news... closed question, gaining agreement and then straight to it - referring back if necessary
- Ending the silence...
- BUILDING and TESTING YOUR AUTHORITY: How do you know if your boss respects your contribution?

## Summary
- influencing those outside of maths...? Our engagement with THEIR agenda
- the use of surprise - vocabulary, passion
- influencing fellow techies: polite and open and honest.
- Planning for all eventualities
- Being clear about objects
- Every opportunity is a learning experience
- This never ends...
